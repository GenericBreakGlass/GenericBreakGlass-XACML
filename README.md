# GenericBreakGlass: XACML Reference Implementation 
Todayâ€™s IT systems implement fine-grained access control mechanisms
to protect a companies assets and to fulfill regulations such as
Basel III, SoX or HIPAA . In general, access control cannot fully
capture all requirements. In particular, for exceptional situations it
is hard to formulate access control policies taking all possible
legitimate accesses into account.  Exceptional Access Control is an
approach for allowing users to override access control decisions in,
e.g., emergency situations. Different approaches and techniques
have been presented how to allow the user to override access control
restrictions in a controlled way, e. g., Break (the) Glass,
Overriding Access Control, or related approaches such as Optimistic
Security. 

This project contains an XAML PDP/PEP infrastructure supporting 
Break Glass Access control.
