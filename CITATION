	abstract  = {Access control models are usually static, i.e., 
                     permissions are granted based on a policy that only 
                     hanges seldom. Especially for scenarios in health care 
                     and disaster management, a more flexible support of 
                     access control, i.e., the underlying policy, is needed.
 
                     break-glass is one approach for such a flexible support of 
                     policies which helps to prevent system stagnation that could 
                     harm lives or otherwise result in losses. Today, break-glass 
                     techniques are usually added on top of standard access control 
                     solutions in an ad-hoc manner and, therefore, lack an 
                     integration into the underlying access control paradigm and the 
                     systems' access control enforcement architecture.

                     We present an approach for integrating, in a fine-grained manner, 
                     break-glass strategies into standard access control models and 
                     their accompanying enforcement architecture. This integration 
                     provides means for specifying break-glass policies precisely 
                     and supporting model-driven development techniques based on such 
                     policies.},
